Text:

Design Walz is a way of continuing to share knowledge while traveling around the country, continent or world.

By working in several agencies and companies you are able to build a sustainable network with meaningful contacts. Going on a Walz means expanding your comfort zone while focussing on learning and your creativity. A Walz is based on trust and respect between all participants.

We adapted the idea of the Walz from an old craftsman tradition and want to implement it for Designers. One of the obstacles is the missing contact to a network that could support people on their Walz. So we want to build that community.
