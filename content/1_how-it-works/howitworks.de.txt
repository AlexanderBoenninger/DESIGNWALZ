Reminder-w:

A Design Walz is a serious way of further education. Do not take a walz lighthearted and use it s a gap filler. Beeing a walzer means to be fully committed to the whole journey and to treat every person and every task with respect.
If you want to do it,  do it right!

----

Reminder-h: A walz is a serious way of further education – not only for the Walzer but also for yourself. Trust one another and see the benifit in people that are different to you. Be open to learn from them and teach them equally. They are not cheap workers, they are valuable collaboration partners and so are you!
